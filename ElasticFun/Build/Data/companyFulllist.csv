Founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, who were attending Stanford University at the time, Google was first incorporated as a privately held company on September 4, 1998.

From the outset, Google's core product has been its internet search engine, which remains the most popular such service across the globe. The company boasts one of the largest research groups in the world tasked with solving search problems and improving the process of accessing information.

Beyond its search engine, Google has introduced a significant number of successful products, including Gmail, Google Maps, an office suite and applications for web browsing, instant messaging and photo editing. The vast majority of Google's revenue is gained through advertising, however. Its AdWords program offers businesses an opportunity to promote their products to a targeted audience, while its AdSense program allows third parties within the Google Network to generate revenue through relevant advertisements.

The numbers tell the story of Google's global reach. The company runs more than 1 million servers in data centers around the world and processes more than 1 billion search requests on a daily basis, according to estimates.

Currently headquartered at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, Google was reincorporated in Delaware in 2003 and operates six data centers across the U.S., one in Belgium and another in Finland. Plans are in place for the completion of three more data centers in Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

The leading risk factors facing Google include constantly changing technology, shifting consumer demand, service disruptions and increased competition from both established and startup companies in industries ranging from traditional media to social networking.

A significant fraction of the company's efforts also go toward marketing and advertising as it believes such efforts are essential to the development and sale of its products.

The company - the principal executive offices of which are located at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California 95014 - has retail stores around the world, with more than 300 locations as of 2012. Apple has five reportable operating segments: Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail. The geographic-based segments do not include the results of the Retail segment.

Despite Apple's market-leading position, the company still faces a number of risk factors, which include changing global economic conditions, fluctuating consumer demand, worldwide-competition and potential supply chain disruptions.

CSCO,"Cisco Systems, Inc.",29.98,150492372841.32,1990,Technology,Computer Communications Equipment,http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/csco," Cisco (ticker symbol: CSCO) is the world's largest supplier of networking equipment and systems, playing an important role in a wide variety of computing fields. The company was founded in 1984 in San Francisco, California, by a pair of Stanford University computer engineers - Len Bosack and Sandy Lerner. The two named the company after a common nickname for San Francisco.

Entering the market as computers began to play a more widespread role in business, Cisco focused on developing routers. In particular, the company emphasized the development of multiple-protocol routers, eventually expanding into Ethernet switching after the acquisition of several companies in that field. Cisco's strong pursuit of service providers in the early days of the internet provided it a dominant market position in the late 1990s and early 2000s, at one point becoming the most valuable company in the world.

Routers, switches and other network systems still account for a significant proportion of Cisco's overall product offerings, but its portfolio has since expanded to include software services such as security and video conferencing. The company still largely targets businesses, but its Linksys access points and switches are a prominent part of the consumer market.

Since its founding 30 years ago, Cisco has migrated away from its namesake, moving its headquarters south to 170 West Tasman Drive, San Jose, California 95134. However, with 60,000 employees the company features locations around the world, including a major presence in India with its Globalisation Centre East in Bangalore.

Despite strong recent performance, Cisco still faces a wide variety of risk factors, including uncertain demand for network products during economic downturns, growing challenges from domestic and international competitors and potential supply chain interruptions.

The name Intel derives from the phrase Integrated Electronics.

In 1971, Intel introduced the first microprocessor after several years of producing semiconductor-based memory storage products, revolutionizing the shape of the global computing industry. The company's most important products remain its microchips, which power a huge number of the personal computers, tablets and smartphones around the world,. However, it also manufactures a wide variety of different chipsets, memory solutions, mobile phone components, software and services.

Intel remains one of the great research and development powerhouses of Silicon Valley, pushing forward chip technology and manufacturing through what it calls its ""tick-tock technology development cadence."" Its main focus is continuously improving the speed, efficiency and portability of its chip products, and the company boasts of a major role in bringing about the realization of Moore's law, which asserted in 1965 ""that transistor density on integrated circuits would double about every two years.""

Although Intel's principal executives offices remain in California and the technology company is incorporated in Delaware, its manufacturing and research facilities sprawl across the United States and, indeed, the globe, with major operations in New Mexico, Arizona, Massachusetts, Ireland, China and Israel. The growing importance of smartphones and lightweight tablets and notebooks led to a surge of investment in smaller, more efficient and cheaper chips. In fact, Intel will become the first company to construct a high-volume facility for 14nm process technology.

Risk factors facing the company include a downturn in general business conditions or the technology industry in particular, currency and commodity price fluctuation, disruption of the global supply chain and major shifts in business and consumer and behavior for tech products.

innovative medicines consisting of novel therapeutics paired with diagnostics
for the treatment of cancer. We were founded by a team of scientists from The
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University who sought to
develop a systems biology-based approach to biomedical research. The core of our
approach to systems biology is to apply multidisciplinary and multitechnology
capabilities to build functional and predictive computational models of
biological systems, such as cell signaling networks, that allow us to engineer
treatments that are directed at the mechanisms of disease. We view cancer as a
complex engineering challenge. Through systems biology, which brings together
the fields of biology, computing and engineering, we aim to decrease uncertainty
in drug development and clinical validation, and move discovery efforts beyond
trial and error.&nbsp;&nbsp;... More ...&nbsp;&nbsp;

antibody therapeutics. Our pipeline of full-length human bispecific antibody

simultaneously block receptors that drive tumor cell growth and survival and to
mobilize the patient's immune response by activating various killer cells to
eradicate tumors. In our pre-clinical studies, our bispecific antibody
candidates were effective in killing tumor cells, a result that we believe
supports their potential efficacy in the treatment of cancer. In February 2015,
we commenced a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our lead bispecific antibody

set forth at the end of this Item 1 as you review this section.

Overview

We are a commercial-stage oncology company developing a novel, proprietary
therapy called TTFields for the treatment of solid tumor cancers. TTFields is a
low-toxicity anti-mitotic treatment that uses low-intensity, intermediate
frequency, alternating electric fields to exert physical forces on key molecules
inside cancer cells, disrupting the basic machinery necessary for normal cell
division, leading to cancer cell death. Physicians have typically treated
patients with solid tumors using one or a combination of three principal
treatment modalities--surgery, radiation and pharmacological therapies. Despite
meaningful advancements in each of these modalities, a significant unmet need to
improve survival and quality of life remains.&nbsp;&nbsp;... More ...&nbsp;&nbsp;

limitation, global annual sales from currently marketed rhGH products have grown
